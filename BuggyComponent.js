This React component uses the wrong lifecycle method to update the state, leading to unexpected behavior.  The `componentWillMount` lifecycle method is deprecated and is not called during server-side rendering.  Using `useEffect` with an empty dependency array ensures the state is updated correctly on the client-side, even after server-side rendering.
